        "When the Internet is used as a way station on the route to enhancing
        existing relationships and forging new social connections, it is a
        useful tool for reducing loneliness. But when social technologies are
        used to escape the social world and withdraw from the ‚Äúsocial pain‚Äù of
        interaction, feelings of loneliness are increased"

        We all face loneliness at some point in our lives. Moving to another
        city, starting uni, joining a sport group ‚Äì they might pose a social
        challenge. We often use technology to solve problems, but it seems like
        social media actually increases this particular problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Facebook, Instagram and others are built to serve social loneliness ‚Äì
        that is the need to have many friends. But on the other side, they
        increase emotional loneliness, the kind of loneliness in which you miss
        an intimate tie. Well, we believe that technology can also help us form
        meaningful friendships, when designed to that purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the Covid-19 crisis immerged on March 2020, we lost the ability to
        physically meet and form connections. Not only that, connections are no
        longer spontaneous. On the past year, you probably had to initiate and
        somehow find people that share the same interests as you. If you
        succeeded ‚Äì horray! But if you‚Äôre like the rest of us, then Jmeet would
        be a great solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the reason we‚Äôve created Jmeet: we wish to help the student
        community in Jerusalem maintain a strong social experience during
        Covid-19. Our goal is to decrease sense of loneliness by creating an
        online platform for forming meaningful and intimate connections among
        students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jmeet is an application that matches students (like yourself) who have
        similar interests and is built to bypass both mental and technological
        obstacles that prevent students from forming new friendships online. We
        use machine learning to find other students that best matches you, and
        help to connect. The only members who are allowed on this app are HUJI
        students, that‚Äôs it. You can choose whether you‚Äôd like to meet people in
        small groups (up to five people) or in person, one-on-one.
      </p>

        Sounds good? Sign-up and try it, the worse thing that can happened is
        that you‚Äôll find you next best friend üòä
